# Alexa-Scribe

My aim for this project was to build a Python library that automated communcation Amazon Voice Services. 
Currently, Amazon requires that to trigger any Alexa capabilities the user either needs to initate a voice command 
(i.e. 'Hey Alexa') or use the mobile application to click and set alarms and such. I believe there is an array of
applications that can be used to automate user's liveswith data that is currently being collected. 
[Chronos'](https://github.com/dwallach1/chronos-ios) purpose is to showcase just one application that
 can be used by using alexa-scribe.




The goal of this project is to automate your alarm system. Originally, I wanted to use my Amazon Echo; however, due to the
restrictions that Amazon imposes on third party developers, I built the system using a Raspberry Pi 3. I used code 
from [here](https://github.com/nicholasjconn/python-alexa-voice-service) as the base of this project. That repo 
intilaizes the connection between the Raspberry Pi and Amazon Voice Services. From there, I tweaked the main file as 
well as several others to account for automation as well as to run as a Flask App. I then added chronos.py and 
chronos_calendar.py.


** I have yet to seperate Chronos and alexa-scribe, so until I do, they are dependent on one another.
		The scibe.py file has not yet been integrated, but that is my next step. It will serve to please this issue 

- Chronos.py handles generating audio files based on the alarm time determined by the system
- Chronos_calendar.py checks your google calendar for upcoming events


# Workflow

- The user downloads the [iOS application](https://github.com/dwallach1/chronos-ios) that tracks their location 
and notifies the system when the user enters or exits thier home. The user is able to input their home address 
and update their sleeping preferences in order to let the system better determine their wake up time.

- The system will be using ngrok to expose our local server (local host 5000) to the web to allow our 
iOS application to post location events to the system.
 
- The inner system will be running on Flask to execute a python module (main.py) to then check the user's Google calendar 
and see their events for the next day and set their alarm based on their schedule as well as user defined preferences.

- The python module generates two wav files: (1) a wake file to trigger Alexa to begin the alarm actions and (2) a content
 file with time for the desired alarm constructor/destructor. Chronos uses gTTS to generate mp3 files and then pydub to 
 convert mp3s to wav files. From there it gets the bytes of the wav file and sends them to AVS. 

 ** For the alarm to work, AVS requires that we set up a downstream channel for back and forth communication with AVS. The 
 [inital project](https://github.com/nicholasjconn/python-alexa-voice-service) handled the communication. 

# Running It

1. ./ngrok http 5000
2. python3 main.py
3. input the ngrok address into the server screen of the iOS application
4. let the [Chronos iOS application](https://github.com/dwallach1/chronos-ios) do the rest

# Dependencies

 - Python3
 - CherryPy
 - gTTS
 - pydub
 - google api client


# To Do

- Currently, by hacking into the program, I have disabled Alexa's general application to allow for the automation. 
The main next goal is to allow for both functionalities simultaneously. 
- Extract alexa-scribe from Chronos (seperate the two entities)
