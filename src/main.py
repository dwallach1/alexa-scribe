This file initalizes:
    - a logger
    - Flask app 
    - Alexa device
    - Hotword detector

Together, these are used to process user and web requests to be parsed, sent to Amazon Voice Services (AVS)
and act upon responses from AVS.

WORKFLOW
--------
Startup:
1. optional command line arguments are parsed and global variables are set based on these args
2. config.dict is parsed and the Alexa device is initalized 
3. wakeword begins running 
4. flask application begins running, exposing the package to be accessed via web reqeusts

running:
- hotword detected will run the start_services function and set the hotword parameter to True (default is False).
If the system is currently parsing a seperate request (from the Scribe queue), it will tell the user to that it is busy
and to try again. Otherwise, it will use the microphone as input and send the bytes to AVS
- A Scribe request made from an external service will spawn a new thread that blocks until the system is not busy,
and then processes the request

Main thread handles all the initalizatinon,
begin new thread for each request -->
    1. if it is a user request and the device is busy stop.
    2. if it is a Scribe request and the device is busy, spin unitl device is free and then process request
This is because I do not envision this collision happening often, can handle this better at a later time.

"""
WHAT TO TEST :

Need to make sure second thread blocks while processing request --
-- if hotword detected but processing thread, then say message
if opposite then wait to run 

-- check how many threads, main thread and 2 threads ? or 1 main thread and one checking thread

TODO:
- add logging
- ensure no threading errors
- add locking b/c of ^
- what happens when no join() call is made to threads -- make sure properly cleaning up
- initalizing global variables?!
- can two threads have the same name?
